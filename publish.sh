# Publish the CURRENT TREE to GitHub as a single commit, with no history.
#
# Why this exists: the tracked scripts carry account numbers, the monthly
# basket and its share counts. Those are fine to show as they stand today,
# but a normal push would also publish every past month's basket forever --
# and a commit, once fetched by anyone, cannot be recalled.
#
# So the local repository keeps the real history (commit on master as usual;
# that is what lets you see what changed and when), and publishing builds a
# throwaway orphan branch holding one commit whose tree is exactly the
# working tree, then force-pushes it over origin/master. GitHub therefore
# never holds more than the latest state.
#
# Usage:  ./publish.sh  ["a one-line note for the snapshot"]
#
# Caveat, stated plainly: a force-push makes the previous remote commit
# unreachable, not deleted. GitHub can still serve an unreachable commit to
# anyone who knows its SHA, and a fork keeps it outright. This protects
# against browsing, cloning and search -- it is not a way to un-publish
# something that was already pushed and seen. Anything that must never be
# public has to stay out of a tracked file in the first place.

# The account. `gh` keeps several accounts in the keyring and ONE of them is
# "active"; its credential helper hands git the active account's token unless
# the remote URL names a user. On 2026-09-02 the active account flipped back to
# jieyis-tech between two publishes and the push was refused with a 403 that
# names the wrong user -- which reads like a permissions problem rather than a
# whose-token problem. Both are handled: the remote URL carries the username,
# and this switches the active account if it has drifted.
